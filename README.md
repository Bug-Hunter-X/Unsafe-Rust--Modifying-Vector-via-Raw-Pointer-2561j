# Unsafe Rust: Modifying Vector via Raw Pointer

This example demonstrates the dangers of directly manipulating vector memory using raw pointers in Rust.  The original code attempts to modify a vector's element using an unsafe block. While seemingly simple, this practice is highly discouraged because it breaks Rust's memory safety guarantees and can lead to unexpected behavior, such as data corruption or memory leaks.

The provided solution replaces the unsafe approach with safe Rust methods, emphasizing the importance of adhering to Rust's memory management paradigm for robust and secure code.
